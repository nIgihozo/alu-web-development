In this and coming projects, you will implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file.

For this first project, you will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.

This designer file will be available on Figma. Figma is cloud-based design and prototyping tools used by UI/UX designers.
Its main strenth is real-time collaboration, allowing multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously
directly in web browser - feel free to create an account to access the final result here:
